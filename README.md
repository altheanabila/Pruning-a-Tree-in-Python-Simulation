# Pruning-a-Tree-in-Python-Simulation

I try to run a simulation of pruning a tree in Python. There are 3 ways to prune a decision a tree in order to make a better decision of available data. Continuing previous simulation I have made earlier: [Decision-Tree-Simulation-in-Python](https://github.com/altheanabila/Decision-Tree-Simulation-in-Python), the simulation is presented.

1. **Maximum Number of Levels in Tree**
by using this syntax:

2. **Maximum Observations at Internal Node**
by using this syntax:

3. **Minimum observations at leaf node**
by using this syntax:
